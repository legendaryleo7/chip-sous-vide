# C.H.I.P Sous Vide


<p>This is a port of the the rasp-sous-vide code to C.H.I.P.</p>

<p>At the most basic level, all that should be required is to adjust the pin mappings to reflect the C.H.I.P headers and find a way to make the DS18b20 work with C.H.I.P.</p>

<p>It is still very much in progress and not functional yet.</p>
